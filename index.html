            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>To become a Game Designer, I have had dreams to be in this field for years now. My end goal would be to leave a longing effect on the gaming industry with my contributions. Although much of my work will most likely be unseen by the masses, I hope that one day it may gain popularity. With what I do create, it will express the unfathomable love I have for such hobbies that I partake in since I was very young. With the strong grasp on what I have always loved, my future projects shall invoke fun game mechanics, but also inspiration for future generations.</p>
