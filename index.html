            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>To become a Game Designer, I have had dreams to be in this field for years now. My end goal would be to leave a longing effect on the gaming industry with my contributions. Although much of my work will most likely be unseen by the masses, I hope that one day it may gain popularity. With what I do create, it will express the unfathomable love I have for such hobbies that I partake in since I was very young. With the strong grasp on what I have always loved, my future projects shall invoke fun game mechanics, but also inspiration for future generations.</p>
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <h3>Lack of Knowledge</h3>
            <p>As many video game companies code in multiple different languages, there are open gaps that we may need to fill that classes themselves don't teach us. Therefore it is only up to our best knowledge to look forward and learn the languages intended for said jobs in these positions. Since most college classes teach specific languages, there should be a course that allows for the students to code in the languages they intend the most on learning, giving them sources that may help with their selected language.  </p>
